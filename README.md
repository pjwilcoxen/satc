# Local Electricity Market (LEM) Model

Simulator for analysis of the cybersecurity implications of highly distributed local electricity markets. Preliminary documentation includes [a list of key classes](docs/classes.md) and a [draft users manual](docs/lem-model-reference-v3.pdf).

Results from this model appear in Dedrick, Perrin, Sabaghian and Wilcoxen, "Assessing cyber attacks on local electricity markets using simulation analysis: Impacts and possible mitigations," in *Sustainable Energy, Grids and Networks* (forthcoming).
